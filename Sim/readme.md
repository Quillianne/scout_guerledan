In the Path_planner file, there are several algorithms to tell the scouts where to go:
    
    - compute_target_points() : uses the position and heading of the Mothership to place the scouts on the plane
    
    - compute_target_points_2() : uses only the position of the mothership to place the scouts. The difficulty is to keep the scouts at the front.

    - compute_target_points_3() : #TODO uses only the distances to place the scouts.
